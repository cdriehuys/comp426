    <h1>The Series</h1>

    <p>
      Darkside came into the post-season with dissappointing losses in all the regular season tournaments they played in.
    </p>

    <h2>Regionals</h2>

    <p>
      Darkside cruised through pool play and into the finals of regionals to earn a matchup against their rival: UNC Wilmington. Darkside stomped Wilmington, prevailing with a 15&ndash;7 victory.
    </p>

    <p>
      Darkside now looked completely different from the team that did not win a single regular season tournament as they headed to Milwaukee as the #3 overall seed.

    <h2>Nationals</h2>

    <p>
      Yada yada yada, they won.
